## 📦 Components
1. **Arduino Board** (e.g., Uno, Nano)
2. **IR Sensors** (e.g., QTR-8A or TCRT5000)
3. **Motor Driver Module** (e.g., L298N or L293D)
4. **DC Motors** with Wheels
5. **Battery Pack** (for powering the motors and Arduino)
6. Chassis and other supporting components

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Sensors**: IR sensors detect the line by differentiating between dark (line) and light (surface).
2. **Control Logic**: Arduino processes the sensor inputs and adjusts motor speeds to keep the robot on track.
3. **Motors**: Motor driver controls the motors to steer the robot accordingly.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed:
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
- Required libraries for IR sensors or motor drivers (if applicable)

### Steps to Build
1. **Assemble the Hardware**: 
   - Mount the IR sensors, motors, and Arduino on the chassis.
   - Connect components as per the circuit diagram.

2. **Upload the Code**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the [robot code](link_to_your_code_file).

3. **Test and Run**:
   - Place the robot on a track with a clear black line on a light surface.
   - Power it up and watch it follow the line!
